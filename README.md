# Loopernet demo

Work very much in progress. Known issues:

* Sound is not in sync with the highligted playing position.  WIP.
* Sometimes you press play and hear nothing. Sound scheduling issues related to the above. Try stopping and starting again.
* Browsers often don't let you hear sound until you've made sound with a gesture. If you connect and the pattern is already playing, try tapping one of the instrument buttons on the left.
